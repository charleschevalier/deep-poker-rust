## Description

Function TrinalClipLoss(advantages, actions, old_probs, new_probs, epsilon_clip, c_1, c_2):

1. Calculate clipped surrogate objective:

```
   ratio = new_probs / old_probs # Calculate probability ratios
   clipped_ratio = torch.clip(ratio, 1 - epsilon_clip, 1 + epsilon_clip)
   surrogate1 = clipped_ratio * advantages
```

2. Calculate second clipped objective:

```
   clipped_advantages = torch.clip(advantages, -c_1, c_1)
   surrogate2 = ratio * clipped_advantages
```

3. Calculate third clipped objective:

```
   clipped_ratio = torch.clip(ratio, 1 - c_2, 1 + c_2)
   surrogate3 = clipped_ratio * advantages
```

4. Combine objectives:

```
   loss = -torch.min(surrogate1, surrogate2, surrogate3).mean()
```

5. Return loss:

```
   return loss
```

## Explanation:

### Clipped surrogate objective:

Constrains the relative change in policy probabilities to mitigate large updates.
Uses the PPO clipping parameter epsilon_clip.

### Second clipped objective:

Further limits the impact of large advantages, preventing potential instability.
Introduces a clipping parameter c_1 specifically for advantages.

### Third clipped objective:

Provides an alternative clipping mechanism to enhance stability and exploration.
Uses a different clipping parameter c_2 for probability ratios.

### Objective combination:

Selects the minimum of the three objectives for each sample, ensuring a conservative update.
Minimizes the overall loss to encourage policy improvement.

## Key points:

Three-way clipping: Provides more robust and stable training compared to traditional PPO with single clipping.<br/><br/>
Parameter tuning: Experimentation with epsilon_clip, c_1, and c_2 is crucial for optimal performance in different domains.<br/><br/>
Adaptability: The Trinal-Clip PPO loss can potentially be applied to other reinforcement learning tasks beyond AlphaHoldem.
