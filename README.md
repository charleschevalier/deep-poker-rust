# deep-poker-rust
Deep learning AI for poker in Rust

This project was a way for me to test new things:
- Rust
- The candle deep learning library
- Reinforcement learning w/ PPO

It is based mostly on the AlphaHoldem paper, implementing:
- Pseudo-siamese embedding layer with convolution
- Actor / critic architecture
- GAE
- Trinal-clip PPO
